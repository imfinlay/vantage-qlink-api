# vantage-qlink-api
A node.js API for the Vantage Qlink API, to test and control a Vantage Qlink home automation system

This has two functions for now:
1. Provide a web UI to test the Vantage API
2. Provide an API to convert HTTP calls to TCP and ensure error responses are HTTP standard instead of Qlink's own
3. Log requests (V commands) and responses to /var/log

The intent is to provide an API interface for home automation systems such as Openhab which don't have a native TCP integration

TODO
1. Enumerate a complete config of a Qlink system, mainly buttons and loads - I'm going to ignore everything else for now
2. Work out how to deal with the data stream from the Qlink system which is generated by events such as button presses
